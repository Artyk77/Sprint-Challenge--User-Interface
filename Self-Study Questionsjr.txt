1. If you were to describe semantic HTML to the next cohort of students, what would you say?

It is important because Semantics is concerned with the meaning of the tags and attributes that you use to build your web pages. 
Through the legacy evolution of running scripts in HTML over time. Web developers realized the need to shift to 
semantic web development in order to start defining what our webpages mean through proper use of HTML, 
which in turn allowed computers to make more sense of our content. This was only the beginning, however, and leads us directly to HTML5.

In other words, semantic HTML is HTML that contains meaning in and of itself, beyond any content that it might be marking up. 
Semantic HTML lets the browser understand what the tag contains, and so will you.
